# Cloud Firebase Function with Express Js

<b>Create Serverless REST API  on Google..</b>

Cloud Functions for firebase are an awesome way or solution for running code in backend  and get response of Firebase events and HTTP requests.
You don’t need to manage your server: just deploy the JavaScript code and let Google do the rest. That way, you won’t need to pay for a server which is running 24/7 even when you get no HTTP requests; you’ll only pay a fixed amount of money for each Function execution, which is way cheaper!


If any query then please post your issue...
